\begin{questions}
    \titledquestion{Plagiarizing in Discrete Math} You surprisingly have more than two friends. Let $n$ be the number of friends you have. You and your friends have managed to get hold of solutions of Discrete Mathematics assignments through whatever means. Each of your friends have the solution of one such assignment. Now you need to share the solutions amongst yourselves, but your RAs are onto you and each of your communication is being monitored. But of course, there are only so many communications three RAs can monitor at a time, so it might very well be that some of the exchanges go undetected. Then again, you need to be safe. So to lower your chances of detection as much as possible, you need to minimize the number of exchanges. Also any gathering of communication between more than two students is always monitored, so only two students can communicate and share solution with each other at a time. At any exchange, two of the students can share all the solutions they currently possess with each other. Prove or disprove the following claim: $2n-2$ exchanges are sufficient to share all the solutions to everyone in your friend group.
